Exploratory analysis on a Washington Post database of police shootings between 2015-2022, done as part of a data science class.

Link to database is provided in the notebook. Find a link to the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11YGWTvKNkd0ZKnTIs2UA2QGXnO4diJqh8TytIiSY89Y/mobilepresent?slide=id.p).

Potential further applications: could be expanded with a more recent dataset (The Washington Post has continued tracking police shootings since after 2022), and could then be included as part of a larger survey or report on the state of police killings in the US.

In our notebook, we first explore general features of the dataset, and then focus on analyzing Albuquerque as a standout city for shootings-per-capita. Similar analyses conducted on multiple cities and states as part of a longer-term project could easily be used to create a "heatmap" denoting "danger zones" across the US: could add a feature that allows a user to go granular and view a state-wise heatmap or a within-city heatmap etc.
